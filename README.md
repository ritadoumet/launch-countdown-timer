# launch-countdown-timer
This Frontend Mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-/hub/launch-countdown-timer-RG4R_SNsl), was definitely harder than it looks. I added a feature which I think is useful (setting the initial remaining time as needed, not necessarily 14 days as it says in the challenge). This was a bit harder to code than I thought, mainly because I had started coding the 14-days one and I changed my mind halfway through!
I only used pure HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript to code it.
One thing that I was too lazy to work on was the flipping of pages, although I know how to implement it (using keyframe 3d animations). 
This project was very fun to work on and I encourage you to do it if you want to refresh your memory on some CSS and JavaScript concepts. 
Happy Coding! :)
